# Pix2Vox++ VAE: 3D Object Reconstruction with Variational Autoencoder

This project is a reimplementation and modification of the paper "Pix2Vox++: Multi-scale Context-aware 3D Object Reconstruction from Single and Multiple Images" with a significant change to the encoder-decoder architecture, transforming it into a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

## Overview

The original Pix2Vox++ is a state-of-the-art method for 3D object reconstruction from single or multiple images. This implementation maintains the multi-scale context-aware approach while introducing a VAE architecture for the encoder-decoder, potentially allowing for more robust and generative 3D reconstructions.

## Key Features

- VAE-based encoder-decoder architecture for 3D object reconstruction
- Multi-scale context-aware approach from the original Pix2Vox++
- Support for both single and multiple image inputs
- [Add any additional features specific to your implementation]

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pix2vox-vae.git
cd pix2vox-vae

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage



## Model Architecture

This implementation differs from the original Pix2Vox++ in the following ways:

1. Encoder: [Describe your VAE encoder architecture]
2. Decoder: [Describe your VAE decoder architecture]
3. Latent Space: [Explain how the latent space is structured and used]


## Results

[Provide some example results, comparisons with the original Pix2Vox++, or any metrics you've used to evaluate your model]
